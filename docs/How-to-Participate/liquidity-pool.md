# Liquidity Pool

The **second step** is to consider adding liquidity to the **ADA/HRV liquidity pool** once it becomes available.  This helps the HARVEST token become more visible, tradable and sustainable on the Cardano blockchain.

Participating in the liquidity pool is **entirely optional** â€” your participation in HARVEST is not affected if you choose not to.  But remember, a healthy pool improves stability and trading depth.

HARVEST is backed by real-world assets and a working business ecosystem, including AI, smart homes and community development.  The liquidity pool is just one piece of a larger picture.

**Your contribution will be appreciated, not required.**
