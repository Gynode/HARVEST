# Stake ADA

The **SECOND STEP** to your success is to add some liquidity to the ADA/HARVEST liquidity pool.  This liquidity pool is one of the important parts of this project so you would be promoting it if you increased the amount of liquidity in the pool although it is not compulsory to do so.

**Not participating** in the liquidity pool will not affect your participation in the project as a whole in any way but remember, the more ADA/HARVEST in the liquidity pool the bigger are its chances of being a success on the Cardano blockchain.  HARVEST'S sustainability of its liquidity on Cardano is not the only measure of its success.  The real determinant of HARVEST'S increase in value is its real world participation in Cardano and other blockchains as well as its interests in Artificial Intelligence training in a few diverse application areas.

Both AI and Blockchain are cutting edge areas and HARVEST is involved in both.

**Your contribution to the ADA/HARVEST liquidity pool will be greatly appreciated.**
