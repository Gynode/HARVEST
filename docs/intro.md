# Introduction

Let’s discover **what HARVEST is really all about**.

## Beyond the Pump-and-Dump

Everyone’s trying to catch the next moon token — hoping for a pump-and-dump, a few gains, and maybe a story to tell.  But how many of us have actually succeeded this way?  The answer is clear: not many.

There is power in numbers.  HARVEST is about **cooperation over speculation**.  If we pool our ADA and HARVEST tokens into a focused, ethical liquidity base, we stop chasing hype and start building value — together.

## What is HARVEST?

HARVEST is a **RWA-backed (Real World Assets)**, spiritually grounded blockchain project designed to reclaim legacy, restore dignity and build wealth ethically.  Buying the HARVEST token (symbol: **HRV**) means holding a **Cardano Native Token (CNT)** that acts as a receipt — proof of real-world participation in a network of small businesses, developers and underdog entrepreneurs trying to make things work.

Like CSWAP — which emerged from the ashes of a painful, drawn-out legal fight with Sundaeswap — HARVEST wasn’t born in comfort.  It was born in resistance.  Those of us who were there know: they lost the lawsuit, and we were paid out in worthless tokens.  But the real outcome was CSWAP, and now HARVEST — a token not based on hype, but on **intention**.

## How It Works

The HARVEST token gets its utility from its connection to **Blockchain, AI and real-world businesses** (yes, actual businesses that repair homes, build smart systems and cook food).  Its value will be recalculated approximately **once a year** when a liquidity pool is created on CSWAP.  Those who wish to sell will be able to, and those who want to hold can do so knowing that the price reflects actual activity and investment.

To protect against whales and dumpers, HARVEST won’t launch via a DEX.  Instead, it will use a **smart wallet** where ADA is sent, and HRV is returned at a fixed ADA:HRV rate.  This keeps it fair and clean.

More on how to do this is available under the **"How to Participate"** menu.

## What Makes HARVEST Different?

- **No inflation** — lost wallets are treated as burned, reducing supply  
- **No whales** — launch strategy is anti-whale by design  
- **No illusions** — HRV is not a meme, it’s a tool  
- **RWA-backed** — value is tied to real assets and businesses  
- **Shari’ah-aligned** — built with Islamic finance principles in mind  
- **Trust by transparency** — not empty slogans, but clear on-chain records

## The Trust Issue

Yes — we’re asking you to send ADA to someone you might not know.  Welcome to crypto.  We've all been rugged, scammed or overpromised at some point.

So here’s the honest advice: **only buy what you can afford to lose**.  Or buy small.  Or wait.  Follow us on Twitter or Discord.  See how the project evolves.  Join later when you’re ready.

We’re building this for the long run — not to fly in and out overnight.  If you choose to join now, you’re not just holding tokens.  You’re holding a piece of a bigger plan.
