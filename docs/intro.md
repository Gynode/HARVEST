# Introduction

Let's discover **What HARVEST token is all about**.

## The More, the Merrier

Everyone works on their own trying to get in to the next "moon" token so they can do a "pump-and-dump"
and be happy with their gains.  This is all good and well but how many of us have really succeeded in
making any significant gains in this way.

The answer to all of this is that there is power in numbers.

So, if we form a large enough group and pool our ADA/HARVEST together into one massive liquidity token, then it automatically makes one large pool to attract the attention of other investors .

## The HARVEST Project

Buying the HARVEST token would be buying a Cardano Native Token (CNT) as a receipt token representing your investment in the project.  The growth of the project would be in our hands.  We do this through real world involvement in cutting-edge computer science fields which we will say more about in the next paragraph.  Obviously, there can be no guarantee of growth but, starting with a HARVEST liquidity pool is a small guarantee of sorts.  This liquidity will, hopefully, be on CSWAP DEX, a unique dex amongst all the Cardano dexes.  The HARVEST project arose in the same way as CSWAP: Both were forced into private financial recovery after being taken for a ride by the Sundaeswap team.  Without boring you with the details of that three year saga, it's enough to say that they lost the lawsuit that a group of us initiated and we were paid out in useless Sundaeswap tokens in the end.   

The HARVEST token has utility resulting from real world participation in the Blockchain and AI industries and its value will be determined at a later date (about yearly) when a pool will be created on CSWAP DEX for those who wish to sell their HARVEST tokens.  All investments made up till then will be used to determine the new price of the HARVEST token at that time which will be used to set the price of HARVEST in the HARVEST/ADA pool.  Obviously, any increase in the ADA value will also increase the value of the HARVEST token.  Anyone wishing to buy more HARVEST at that time can obviously do so.

The problem with buying via a liquidity token on a dex is that special consideration must be made for whales who will destroy the token with a huge pump and dump.  To prevent this HARVEST has elected to sell via a wallet where ADA deposited will initiate a return of HARVEST tokens according to a pre-determined ADA:HARVEST rate.  This is, of course, also the price of HARVEST in terms of ADA.

More about this and also detailed guidelines on how to do this can be found under the "Buy HARVEST tokens" sub-menu option.  First select the "How to Participate" menu item.

That's basically it:  Buy the amount of tokens that you can afford and then just sit back, relax and follow us on Twitter and Discord so you know what's happening.

## The Trust Issue

One obvious problem is that we are asking you to buy the HARVEST token by sending your ADA to someone you don't even know.

Isn't this what cryptocurrency is all about.  Buying "stuff" blindly.  We all do it and we all have been scammed, rugged and hacked at some point in our crypto lives.  If you're not sure then rather don't get involved or buy small and wait to see what happens after a few months.  This is a long-term project so even if you just follow us on Twitter and Discord and do nothing else that would be great.  Make your decision to join a few months down the line when you are more comfortable.

Notice that the HARVEST project will have its own liquidity pool with the same name so this should be some indication of its 
permanency.  This is no fly-by-night project.  Here today, gone tomorrow. 

There isn't much that we can say about trust on this platform so all we can really advise is buy as many HARVEST tokens as you can afford to lose!
